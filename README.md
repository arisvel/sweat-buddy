I built this project for a university course alongside some of my extraordinary colleagues and friends. The project basically consists of a backend server implemented from scratch in Java using sockets and threads that manages worker nodes and distributes load to them. The results come back to the main server, which then presents them to the clients It also has a frontend built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose because we need to have fun by making things overcomplicated instead of serving plain html files.

This was the project that laid the foundation for my thinking in software engineering, from setting up a full-stack app from backend all the way to frontend.
You can see the project briefly in the video that follows:
